He wanted to convince local people there to follow his religion. While he was teaching, however, he learned something. The village healer, the only doctor the people had ever known, was making a powder from the bark of the cinchona tree. He used this powder to cure malaria. The priest brought some of this miracle powder home to Europe, where malaria was a serious disease at the time. Europeans began using the bark to cure malaria. Soon Europeans started to do overseas searches for sources of the tree bark. After many years, scientists found out about the ingredient in the tree bark that cured malaria. It was quinine. By 1827, quinine was commercially produced and became the main treatment for malaria throughout the world. By the 1960s, however, quinine's ability to kill the malaria parasite had declined, because the parasite was becoming resistant to it.",

The scientists want time to find plants that might cure diseases. The business people want to make money from the plants that grow there. Experts believe that about 50,000 species of plants, animals, and insects disappear every year because rainforests are being destroyed. Scientists fear that when rainforest species disappear, many possible cures for diseases will disappear with them. They also fear that when rainforests disappear, the villages of native people, who live there, will also disappear. When the people leave, their healers also leave.
